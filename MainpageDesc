When user opens website, should be taken to a landing paged based on https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/thumbnail-gallery/?
With each thumbnail being a different pic of a different location. Each thumbnail is a link to that location's main page. Maybe a short 
description under each pic with name of place and country?
